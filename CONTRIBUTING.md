## Contributing

**General Rules**

- As much as possible, try to follow the existing format of markdown and code.
- Don't forget to `run code` and test on leetcode platform before submitting pull requests.
- Make sure that **100%** of your code is covered by tests (can be submitted on leetcode).

**Contributing New Translation**

- Create new `README.xx-XX.md` file with translation alongside with 
main `README.md` file where `xx-XX` is [locale and country/region codes](http://www.lingoes.net/en/translator/langcode.htm).
For example `en-US`, `zh-CN`, `zh-TW`, `ko-KR` etc.
- You may also translate all other sub-folders by creating 
related `README.xx-XX.md` files in each of them.

**Contributing New Algorithms**

- Make your pull requests to be **specific** and **focused**. Instead of 
contributing "several algorithms solutions" all at once contribute them all 
one by one separately (i.e. one pull request for "Two Sum Problem", another one
for "Integer to Roman Problem" and so on).
- Preferred to provide **README.md** for each of the solutions **with explanations** of
the algorithm and **with links** to further readings.
- Describe what you do in code using **comments**.
