# Intuition & Approach
The `specialArray` function implements a solution to *find a "special" integer within an array*. Here's an intuition and approach for how the code works:

1. The `specialArray` method takes an array of integers `nums` as input and returns an integer.

2. It initializes `low` and `high` variables to define *the range of possible values for the special integer*. `low` is initially set to `0`, and `high` is set to *the length of the input array*.

3. The code enters a while loop that *continues as long as `low` is less than or equal to `high`*. This loop uses a **binary search algorithm** to efficiently narrow down the range and find the special integer.

4. Inside the loop, it calculates the midpoint `mid` of the current range. This midpoint represents the value being checked for its special property.

5. The `countGreaterOrEqual` method is called, passing the array nums and the current midpoint `mid` as arguments. This method iterates over the array and *counts the number of elements that are greater than or equal to mid*.

6. If the count `cgoe` is equal to `mid`, it means that `mid` is the special integer. In this case, the method returns `mid` as the result.

7. If `cgoe` is greater than `mid`, it implies that there are more than `mid` elements in `nums` that are greater than or equal to `mid`. Therefore, the special integer should be in the range `[mid + 1, high]`. Consequently, `low` is updated to `mid + 1` to search in the higher range.

8. If `cgoe` is less than mid, it indicates that there are fewer than `mid` elements in `nums` that are greater than or equal to `mid`. Thus, the special integer should be in the range `[low, mid - 1]`. Consequently, `high` is updated to `mid - 1` to search in the lower range.

9. If the while loop completes without finding the special integer, the method returns `-1` to indicate that there is no special integer in the array.

The ***binary search algorithm*** employed in this code allows for efficient searching in the array. It repeatedly divides the search range in half, reducing the search space by half with each iteration. This approach results in a time complexity of $$O(log n)$$, where n is the size of the input array (within each iteration of the binary search, it calls the `countGreaterOrEqual` method, which has a time complexity of $$O(n)$$ due to the loop iterating over the entire array).

Additionally, the code uses the ***principle of breaking down*** a complex problem into smaller subproblems. By dividing the search range and counting the number of elements greater than or equal to a particular value, the algorithm progressively narrows down the search space until the special integer is found or the search range is exhausted.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $$O(n*logn)$$
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

- Space complexity: $$O(1)$$
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

# Code
```
class Solution {
    public int specialArray(int[] nums) {
        int low = 0, high = nums.length;

        while(low <= high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2, 
                cgoe = countGreaterOrEqual(nums, mid);
                
            if(cgoe == mid)
                return mid;
            else if(cgoe > mid)
                low = mid + 1;
            else
                high = mid - 1;
        }

        return -1;
    }

    private int countGreaterOrEqual(int[] m, int v) {
        int c = 0;

        for(int i = 0; i < m.length; i++)
            if(m[i] >= v)
                c++;
        
        return c;
    }
}
