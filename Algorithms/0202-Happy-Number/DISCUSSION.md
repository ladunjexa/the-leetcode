# Intuition & Approach
The given code is an implementation of the `Happy Number` problem in Java.

A happy number is a number that eventually reaches 1 when replaced by the sum of the square of each digit in the number, and this process is repeated with the resulting sum until the number either equals 1 or the process loops endlessly in a cycle that does not include 1.

The approach used in this code is to repeatedly square the digits of the given number, until either 1 is reached or the process loops endlessly in a cycle.

If the given number is less than 10, the code checks if it's either 1 or 7, as any number less than 10 can only be a happy number if it's either 1 or 7.

If the given number is not less than 10, the code starts by initializing a variable `op` to zero, and then repeatedly squares each digit of the number (by using modulo operator and integer division) and adds it to the variable `op` until there are no digits left (i.e., until n becomes zero).

The resulting sum, `op`, is then recursively passed back to the isHappy() function to repeat the process until either 1 is reached or the process loops endlessly in a cycle.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $$O(k*logn)$$ where `k` is the number of recursive calls made by the function.
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

- Space complexity: $$O(k)$$
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

# Code
```java []
class Solution {

    public boolean isHappy(int n) {
        if(n < 10)
            return (n == 1 || n == 7);
        
        int op = 0;

        do {
            op += (n % 10) * (n % 10);
            n /= 10;
        } while(n != 0);

        return isHappy(op);
    }
}
```

# DOC Code
``` java []
// Defines a public method called "isHappy" that takes an integer parameter "n" and returns a boolean value.
public boolean isHappy(int n) {    

    // Checks if the input number is less than 10.
    if(n < 10)                    
        return (n == 1 || n == 7); // Returns true if the input number is equal to 1 or 7, and false otherwise.
    
    // Initializes a new integer variable "op" with the value 0.
    int op = 0;                   

    do {                          
    // Enters a do-while loop that executes at least once.
        op += (n % 10) * (n % 10);
        // Computes the square of the last digit of the input number and adds it to "op".
        n /= 10;                  
        // Removes the last digit of the input number by dividing it by 10.
    } while(n != 0);              
    // Continues looping until all digits of the input number have been processed.

    // Recursively calls the "isHappy" method with the new value of "op".
    return isHappy(op);           
}
```
