## [350. Intersection of Two Arrays II](https://leetcode.com/problems/intersection-of-two-arrays-ii/)
### Easy
<hr/>
Given two integer arrays <code>nums1</code> and <code>nums2</code>, return <em>an array of their intersection</em>. Each element in the result must appear as many times as it shows in both arrays and you may return the result in <strong>any order</strong>.

#### Example 1:
<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> nums1 = [1,2,2,1], nums2 = [2,2]
<strong>Output:</strong> [2,2]
</pre>

#### Example 2:
<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> nums1 = [4,9,5], nums2 = [9,4,9,8,4]
<strong>Output:</strong> [4,9]
<strong>Explanations:</strong> [9,4] is also accepted.
</pre>

### Constraints:
<ul>
  <li><code>1 &lt;= nums1.length, nums2.length &lt;= 1000</code></li>
  <li><code>0 &lt;= nums1[i], nums2[i] &lt;= 1000</code></li>
</ul>
</div>

### Follow up:
* What if the given array is already sorted? How would you optimize your algorithm?
* What if nums1's size is small compared to nums2's size? Which algorithm is better?
* What if elements of nums2 are stored on disk, and the memory is limited such that you cannot load all elements into the memory at once?
